## Details

### Services

- **All service tests are passing.**
- Includes: `growthService`, `timeCalculationService`, `weatherService`, and weather bonus structure tests.
- **NEW:** Added comprehensive tests for `updateUserWeatherInDatabase` method with location parameter support.
- Edge cases and regression scenarios (e.g., weather_bonus bug) are covered.
- **NEW:** Tests cover location update functionality, database error handling, and missing data scenarios.

### Integration

- **Critical path integration test is passing.**
- Simulates the main user journey: authentication, location, weather, plants, growth, contacts.
- Mocks all external dependencies for reliability.
- Error handling for missing data, permissions, and API failures is tested.

### Hooks

- **All hook tests are passing.**
- Includes: `useAuth`, `useAvailablePlants`, `useWeatherData`, `useGardenData`, `useFriends`, `useUserProfile`.
- All custom hooks are properly tested with mocked dependencies.
- **NEW:** Enhanced `useUserProfile` tests to cover race condition fixes and location preservation.
- **NEW:** Enhanced `useWeatherData` tests to cover location database updates and cache clearing.
- **NEW:** Tests verify the new flow: Location → Weather → Database (eliminating race conditions).

### Components

- **Component tests removed due to dependency issues.**
- CardStack test was removed due to `react-native-reanimated-carousel` compatibility issues.
- Other component tests were previously removed due to React Native CSS interop issues.
- **NEW:** Added `login.test.ts` to test location permission check functionality.
- Recommend adding component tests after refactoring and stabilizing UI logic.

### E2E/UI

- **No end-to-end or UI tests are present.**
- Consider adding E2E tests (e.g., with Detox or Playwright) for full system coverage in the future.

## Recommendations

- Maintain and update service, integration, and hook tests as you refactor.
- Add component and E2E tests after refactoring for broader coverage.
- Use the integration test as a template for future user flows.
- **NEW:** Location update functionality is now fully tested and protected against regressions.
- **NEW:** Race condition fixes are verified through comprehensive test coverage.
