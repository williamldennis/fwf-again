# Hooks Refactor Recommendation

## Problem

- `useAppInitialization` is doing too much (weather, friends, plants, profile)
- `useWeatherData` depends on coordinates from `useAppInitialization`
- UserCard missing weather data due to dependency chain
- Sequential execution instead of parallel

## Revised Solution: Staged Hook Execution

### Analysis of Parallel Execution Issues

After analyzing the code, running hooks in parallel would cause:

- ðŸš¨ **Location permission race conditions** between hooks
- ðŸš¨ **Database write conflicts** when updating user profile
- ðŸš¨ **Duplicate weather API calls** from multiple hooks
- ðŸš¨ **Dependency chain** still exists (weather needs location)

### Current State

```
useAppInitialization (does everything)
â”œâ”€â”€ User auth
â”œâ”€â”€ Profile data (selfie URLs, points, location)
â”œâ”€â”€ Weather fetching
â”œâ”€â”€ Friends fetching
â””â”€â”€ Plants fetching
```

### Proposed State: Staged Execution

```
Stage 1: Parallel (Core + Social)
â”œâ”€â”€ useAppInitialization (core app state)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ User auth
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Available plants
â””â”€â”€ useFriendsData (social features)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Friends fetching
    â””â”€â”€ Plants fetching

Stage 2: Sequential (User + Weather)
â”œâ”€â”€ useUserProfile (user-specific data)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ Profile data (selfie URLs, points, location)
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ Location updates
â””â”€â”€ useWeatherData (weather service)
    â”œâ”€â”€ Weather fetching (uses location from useUserProfile)
    â””â”€â”€ Weather caching
```

## Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Extract `useUserProfile` Hook

- Move profile fetching logic from `useAppInitialization`
- Return: `{ userProfile, loading, error, refreshProfile }`
- Keep location update logic

### Step 2: Update `useAppInitialization`

- Remove profile fetching
- Remove weather fetching
- Remove friends/plants fetching
- Keep: user auth, available plants, app initialization status

### Step 3: Update `useWeatherData`

- Accept location as parameter: `useWeatherData(latitude, longitude, isInitialized)`
- Remove dependency on `useAppInitialization`

### Step 4: Extract `useFriendsData` Hook

- Move friends and plants logic from `useAppInitialization`
- Return: `{ friendsData, plantedPlants, loading, error, refreshFriends }`

### Step 5: Update `home.tsx` with Staged Execution

```typescript
// Stage 1: Parallel (Core + Social)
const { currentUserId, availablePlants, isInitialized } =
    useAppInitialization();
const { friendsData, plantedPlants } = useFriendsData(
    currentUserId,
    isInitialized
);

// Stage 2: Sequential (User + Weather)
const { userProfile } = useUserProfile(currentUserId, isInitialized);
const { weather, forecast } = useWeatherData(
    userProfile?.latitude,
    userProfile?.longitude,
    isInitialized
);
```

## Benefits

- âœ… Each hook has single responsibility
- âœ… Friends data loads in parallel with core app
- âœ… No race conditions or duplicate API calls
- âœ… UserCard gets weather data directly
- âœ… Minimal code changes
- âœ… No over-engineering
- âœ… Still faster than current sequential approach

## Files to Modify

1. `src/hooks/useUserProfile.ts` (new)
2. `src/hooks/useFriendsData.ts` (new)
3. `src/hooks/useAppInitialization.ts` (simplify)
4. `src/hooks/useWeatherData.ts` (accept location param)
5. `src/app/home.tsx` (update hook usage)

## Testing Strategy

- Test each hook independently
- Test staged execution (parallel + sequential)
- Verify UserCard gets all data
- Ensure no performance regression
- Test error handling in each stage

## Approval Request

Should I proceed with Step 1 (extracting `useUserProfile`) to test this staged approach?
