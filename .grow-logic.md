## How Plants Grow

### Growth Stages

1. **Stage 1**: Empty pot (when you first tap to plant)
2. **Stage 2**: Dirt (immediately after planting - shows the seed is in the ground)
3. **Stage 3**: Sprout (20% of total growth time)
4. **Stage 4**: Adolescent (40% of total growth time)
5. **Stage 5**: Mature (70% of total growth time, fully grown at 100%)

### Time Calculation

- Each plant has a base growth time (e.g., Sunflower = 4 hours, Mushroom = 2 hours)
- The system calculates: "How many hours have passed since this plant was planted?"
- Then applies weather bonuses based on the friend's current weather

### Weather Effects

- **Sunny weather**: Sunflowers grow 50% faster, Mushrooms grow 60% slower
- **Cloudy weather**: Ferns grow 80% faster, Cactuses grow 40% slower
- **Rainy weather**: Mushrooms grow 100% faster, Cactuses grow 70% slower

### Example

- You plant a Sunflower in your friend's garden at 2:00 PM
- Your friend has sunny weather (Sunflower gets +50% growth bonus)
- Base growth time: 4 hours
- With weather bonus: 4 hours Ã· 1.5 = 2.67 hours to mature
- At 4:40 PM, the Sunflower should be mature

## When Growth is Triggered

### 1. App Opens (every time you open the app)

- System checks all planted plants
- Calculates how much time has passed
- Updates any plants that should advance to next stage

### 2. After Planting (immediately after you plant a seed)

- Updates growth for all plants
- Ensures new plants start at the correct stage

### 3. Every 5 Minutes (while app is open)

- Automatically checks and updates plant growth
- Plants advance through stages based on time elapsed

### 4. Manual Refresh (when you tap "Refresh Plant Growth" in menu)

- Forces an immediate growth check
- Updates all plants and refreshes the display

## What Actually Happens

### Database Updates

- System looks at each plant's `planted_at` timestamp
- Calculates current time minus planted time
- Applies weather bonuses from the friend's current weather
- If a plant should advance, updates `current_stage` (1â†’2â†’3â†’4â†’5)
- When plant reaches stage 5 and 100% progress, sets `is_mature = true`

### Visual Updates

- Garden areas refresh to show new plant stages
- Plant images change from dirt â†’ sprout â†’ adolescent â†’ mature
- Plant details modal shows updated progress and time to maturity

### Real-World Example

- You plant a Mushroom in your friend's garden
- Your friend has rainy weather (Mushroom gets +100% growth bonus)
- Base time: 2 hours, With bonus: 1 hour to mature
- After 1 hour, the Mushroom will be mature and ready to harvest

## Technical Implementation

### Time Tracking

- Uses `planted_at` timestamp stored in database when plant is created
- Calculates elapsed time: `Date.now() - new Date(planted_at).getTime()`
- Converts to hours for growth calculations

### Growth Service

- `GrowthService.calculateGrowthStage()` handles all calculations
- Returns current stage, progress percentage, and whether plant should advance
- Weather bonuses are applied as multipliers to growth speed

### Update Frequency

- Automatic updates every 5 minutes while app is open
- Manual refresh available in menu
- Updates triggered on app open and after planting

The system essentially asks: "Given how much time has passed and the current weather, should this plant be at a more advanced stage?"
