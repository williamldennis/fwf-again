## Technical Notes

### Database Schema (Current)

```sql
-- Plants table with harvest points
CREATE TABLE plants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  name VARCHAR(50) NOT NULL UNIQUE,
  growth_time_hours INTEGER NOT NULL,
  weather_bonus JSONB NOT NULL,
  image_path VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  harvest_points INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);

-- Planted plants with harvest tracking
CREATE TABLE planted_plants (
  id UUID PRIMARY KEY DEFAULT gen_random_uuid(),
  garden_owner_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  planter_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  plant_id UUID REFERENCES plants(id),
  planted_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW(),
  current_stage INTEGER DEFAULT 1,
  is_mature BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
  harvested_at TIMESTAMP,
  harvester_id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### Growth Calculation (Implemented)

```typescript
// Real-time growth calculation with weather bonuses
const growthCalculation = GrowthService.calculateGrowthStage(
    plantedPlant,
    plantObject,
    friendWeather
);

// Returns: { stage: 1-5, progress: 0-100, shouldAdvance: boolean }
```

### Points System (Implemented)

```typescript
// Plant point values based on growth time
Sunflower: 10 points (4 hours)
Mushroom: 8 points (2 hours)
Fern: 15 points (6 hours)
Cactus: 12 points (3 hours)
Water Lily: 18 points (5 hours)
Pine Tree: 25 points (8 hours)
```
