# Progress Update: Migration to Focused Hooks for App Initialization and Data Management

**Date:** 2025-07-16

## Overview

We have completed a major refactor of the app's initialization and data management logic, moving from a monolithic `useAppInitialization` hook to a set of focused, composable hooks. This change improves performance, enables more targeted updates, and makes the codebase easier to test and maintain.

## Rationale

The original `useAppInitialization` hook handled authentication, profile, friends, garden, weather, and plant data in a single place. This led to:

- Unnecessary re-renders and global loading states
- Difficulty in testing and debugging
- Tight coupling between unrelated features

## New Hooks Architecture

We have split responsibilities into the following hooks:

- **`useAuth`**: Manages user authentication state
- **`useUserProfile`**: Handles user profile, location, and points
- **`useFriends`**: Manages friends data, contact fetching, and friend discovery
- **`useGardenData`**: Handles planted plants for user and friends, targeted/batch/growth updates, and real-time subscriptions
- **`useAvailablePlants`**: Lazy loads available plants for the PlantPicker, with caching and manual refresh
- **`useWeatherData`**: Fetches weather data based on location, now decoupled from app initialization

## Implementation Highlights

- All responsibilities from `useAppInitialization` were migrated to the new hooks
- The monolithic hook and its tests were removed
- All usages were updated to use the new hooks directly (e.g., in `home.tsx`)
- Integration and unit tests were updated or created for each hook
- A regression test was added to ensure friends always render in the UI (testing the `isFriend` type guard)
- The hooks are now easier to test in isolation, and the UI is more responsive to targeted data changes

## Benefits

- **Performance**: Only the relevant parts of the UI update when data changes
- **Testability**: Each hook has its own test suite, and regression tests catch type guard issues
- **Maintainability**: Code is modular, easier to debug, and less prone to side effects
- **User Experience**: No more unnecessary global loading states when planting/harvesting or updating friends

## Next Steps

- Continue to monitor for regressions and add more UI-level tests as needed
- Document hook usage patterns for future contributors
