## CardStack Carousel Improvements

### Overview

Significantly improved the CardStack component by implementing a proper horizontal carousel using the `react-native-reanimated-carousel` library, replacing the custom animation implementation that was causing flashing and poor user experience.

### Key Changes

#### 1. **Replaced Custom Animation with Professional Library**

- **Before**: Custom `react-native-reanimated` implementation with complex gesture handling
- **After**: `react-native-reanimated-carousel` library for smooth, reliable carousel functionality
- **Benefits**:
    - Eliminated flashing issues during card transitions
    - Smooth horizontal swiping with proper enter/exit animations
    - Professional-grade carousel behavior
    - Reduced code complexity and maintenance burden

#### 2. **Fixed Carousel Re-sorting Issue**

- **Problem**: Cards would re-sort every time plants were harvested, causing jarring position changes
- **Solution**: Removed `plantedPlants` dependency from the `sortedFriends` `useMemo`
- **Result**: Cards maintain stable positions during gameplay, only re-sorting when friends are added/removed

#### 3 **Improved Card Sizing System**

- **Implemented**: Proper card width/height prop system
- **Added**: `cardHeight` prop to all card components (UserCard, FriendCard, AddFriendsCard)
- **Benefit**: Consistent sizing across all cards with easy customization

### UserCard Styling Enhancements

#### 1. **Visual Improvements**

- **Increased weather text size**: From 16px to 20px for better readability
- **Enhanced Lottie animation**:
    - Increased size from 900x900x1100
    - Adjusted positioning (top: -900) for better visual impact
    - Maintained 0.2 opacity for subtle background effect
- **Removed unnecessary borders**: Cleaned up border styling for cleaner appearance

####2Layout Refinements\*\*

- **Garden area integration**:
    - Added proper bottom corner radius matching (20px)
    - Added padding and margin adjustments for better spacing
    - Seamless integration with card bottom edge
- **Improved spacing**: Added `marginTop: 20to garden area for better visual separation

### Technical Implementation Details

#### CardStack Component

```typescript
// Key improvements:
- Used react-native-reanimated-carousel for reliable animations
- Implemented proper carousel dimensions (width/height props)
- Added overflow hidden to prevent visual artifacts
- Maintained stable card order during gameplay
```

#### UserCard Component

```typescript
// Styling improvements:
- Larger weather text (20px) for better readability
- Enhanced Lottie animation positioning and sizing

```

### Files Modified

- `src/components/CardStack.tsx` - Complete carousel rewrite
- `src/components/UserCard.tsx` - Styling and layout improvements
- `src/components/FriendCard.tsx` - Added cardHeight prop support
- `src/components/AddFriendsCard.tsx` - Added cardHeight prop support

### Dependencies Added

- `react-native-reanimated-carousel` - Professional carousel library

### User Experience Improvements

1. **Smooth Navigation**: No more flashing or jarring transitions between cards
   2**Stable Layout**: Cards don't jump around when harvesting plants
2. **Better Readability**: Larger weather text and improved visual hierarchy4\*Professional Feel\*\*: Carousel behaves like popular apps (Tinder, Instagram Stories)

### Next Steps

- Consider implementing shared styles system for consistent card styling
- Evaluate performance impact of larger Lottie animations
- Test carousel behavior with different screen sizes and orientations

### Notes

The carousel implementation is now production-ready and provides a much more polished user experience. The decision to use a professional library rather than custom animations was the right choice for maintainability and reliability.
