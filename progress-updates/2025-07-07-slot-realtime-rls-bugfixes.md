# Progress Update: Slot-Based Planting, Real-Time Sync, and RLS Fixes

**Date**: July 7, 2025  
**Title**: Slot-Based Planting, Real-Time Sync, and RLS Bugfixes

## Summary

Major improvements were made to the garden system to support slot-based planting, instant real-time updates across users, and robust multi-user data visibility. Several critical bugs were fixed, and the user experience was refined for cross-device and social play.

## Changes Made

### ✅ Slot-Based Planting

- **Slot Column Added**: The `planted_plants` table now includes a `slot` column, allowing each pot (A, B, C) to maintain its position.
- **Migration for Legacy Data**: Existing plants were assigned slots via a SQL migration; UI fallback ensures legacy plants display correctly.
- **UI Update**: Pots now retain their position when planting/harvesting, rather than always filling left-to-right.
- **Consistent Interactions**: Tapping an empty pot opens the plant picker; tapping a filled pot opens the details modal.

### ✅ Real-Time Sync

- **Supabase Realtime**: Subscriptions were added to the `planted_plants` table, enabling instant updates for planting and harvesting across all users and devices.
- **Optimized State Updates**: Only the affected garden is updated in state, improving performance and UX.

### ✅ RLS (Row Level Security) Policy Fix

- **Visibility Bug Fixed**: Gardens now appear correctly to friends. RLS policies were updated to allow all users to view all gardens (`USING (true)`), while still restricting insert/update/delete to the appropriate users.

### ✅ Bugfixes & Testing

- **Plant Count Logic**: Fixed a bug where more than 3 plants could appear in a garden by ensuring only unharvested plants (`harvested_at IS NULL`) are counted.
- **Phantom Plant Issue**: Addressed a race condition where a new plant could appear in the same pot after harvesting.
- **Improved Logging**: Added concise logging for planting and harvesting actions.
- **Multi-User Testing**: Confirmed correct behavior using multiple devices and test users.

### ✅ UI/UX Improvements

- **Consistent Pot Layout**: Pots always display in the same order, even after harvesting or planting.
- **Legacy Data Handling**: UI fallback ensures plants without a slot are shown in the first available slot.
- **Feedback**: Clear feedback for planting, harvesting, and real-time updates.

## Key Decisions

- **Slot-Based Design**: Chosen for clarity and predictability in garden layout.
- **Supabase Realtime**: Used for simplicity and reliability over custom socket solutions.
- **RLS Policy**: Opened SELECT for all users to enable social garden viewing.

## Challenges

- **Legacy Data Migration**: Required careful SQL migration and UI fallback to avoid breaking existing gardens.
- **Race Conditions**: Fixed with improved filtering and state management.
- **Multi-User Consistency**: Achieved through real-time subscriptions and targeted state updates.

## Next Steps

- Continue user testing for edge cases and cross-device consistency.
- Explore additional real-time features (e.g., notifications).
- Refine UI for plant picker and modal interactions.
