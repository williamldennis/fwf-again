I'm looking to build an app called 'fair weather friends' that is very simple -- it just shows you your weather and the weather of your friends.

The rough flow is:

1. Open the app 
2. sign up with phone number
3. verify via one time code (maybe using firebase?)
4. approve their contacts
5. approve their location
6. add selfies for each type of weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, night (for sleeping))
6. land on the home screen where they see their own weather and a list of their friends' weather 

I want to build it in react native using expo. 


Friend logic: Automatic match via contacts (no approvals).

Weather API: Needed.

Selfies: Required. Stored in Supabase Storage.

Refresh: Background updates preferred, no push yet.

Privacy: Not implemented for v1.

Goal: Simple, working MVP with good UX.

Weather API Recommendation
üîπ Option: OpenWeatherMap

Pros: Free tier, global coverage, easy integration, good docs.

Cons: Slightly coarse granularity for short-term weather.

Suggested endpoint: Current Weather Data API

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API_KEY}


üîÅ Background Refresh Strategy
Using expo-task-manager + expo-location:

Register background location task.

When triggered:

Fetch new coordinates.

Hit weather API.

Store updated weather + location + timestamp in supabase.

This keeps data fresh across users, even if they don‚Äôt open the app.

üì± Contacts Matching Flow
Request contact permission via expo-contacts.

Parse local contact phone numbers.

Normalize numbers (e.g. +1, remove dashes).

Query supabase for phoneNumber IN contactList.

Match found ‚Üí friend list.

No approval or friend request needed.
