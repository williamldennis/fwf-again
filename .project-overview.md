I'm looking to build an app called 'fair weather friends' that is very simple -- it just shows you your weather and the weather of your friends.

The rough flow is:

1. Open the app 
2. sign up with phone number
3. verify via one time code (maybe using firebase?)
4. approve their contacts
5. approve their location
6. add selfies for each type of weather (sunny, cloudy, rainy, night (for sleeping))
6. land on the home screen where they see their own weather and a list of their friends' weather 

I want to build it in react native using expo. 


Friend logic: Automatic match via contacts (no approvals).

Weather API: Needed.

Selfies: Required. Stored in Firebase Storage.

Refresh: Background updates preferred, no push yet.

Privacy: Not implemented for v1.

Goal: Simple, working MVP with good UX.

Weather API Recommendation
ðŸ”¹ Option: OpenWeatherMap

Pros: Free tier, global coverage, easy integration, good docs.

Cons: Slightly coarse granularity for short-term weather.

Suggested endpoint: Current Weather Data API

https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/weather?lat={lat}&lon={lon}&appid={API_KEY}

ðŸ”¹ Caching Approach

On user location fetch:

Query Firestore: user.lastUpdated timestamp.

If last update < 30 minutes â†’ fetch new weather.

Else â†’ use cached data in Firestore.
